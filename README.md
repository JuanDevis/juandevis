<H1> Hi, my name is Juan Devis üëã </H1>
### Freelance full-stack wordpress php developer + javascript + html + css

I have been a professional software engineer for more than twelve years.

In 2014 I left my job at a multinational and created 2ffactor, the reflection of my dream of growing as a professional within the software development industry. Since then I have dedicated myself to specializing in the development of mobile applications, collaborating with companies from different parts of the world, creating more than 100 Apps.

In 2018 left my hometown (Venezuela) to move to chile, and started creating programming content and sharing my experience as a developer to different teams.üëè
in 2019 i got to Ecuador and worked in an agency programing hundreds of websites, improving my skilss in javascript, php, sql, wordpress core, firebase and flutter
And finally in 2020 i got to Usa where i started to work on upwork and fiverr getting in the first places posicioning as one of the best in both platforms for wordpress development

In all of these years i have gathered knoledge that i would like to use in platforms, companies and apps to build awesome things and improve somehow the worldüòÅ
